- Our feelings that a few moons ago seemed so close to each other.
- Today appear divergent from one another.
- I wake up hoping that it is all the steaming fumes.
- Escaping from my boiling imagination.
- To feed my vivid delusion.
- Reality catches me up, and carefully reveals to my eyes.
- How nothing seems to have changed, I.
- Love and care about you.
- As much as I’ve ever did.
- You haven’t stopped expressing your concern and passion.
- Staying true to the person that you are.
- The one that one day and everyday.
- Made my heart beat a bit faster.
- Perhaps that the mist « hérisse ma peau ».
- Since day one, was all an illusion, yet.
- Loving you feels easy Gizem.
- That is why I haven’t been able to stop.
- Sending you my perhaps clumsy words.
- Dignes d’un récit de gens qui s’aiment.
