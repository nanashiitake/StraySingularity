- If we could share an instant in eternity,
- I’d want those everlasting hours to exist—
- Under the rainfall of a windy afternoon.
<!-- -->
- I’d gladly spend perpetuity,
- Contemplating the raindrops,
- Gliding down your skin,
- Revealing to my caring eyes,
- The intricate lines of your lips...
<!-- -->
- I would dive into your sparkling eyes,
- And slowly dissolve in your soothing seas,
- Whilst the sunlight of your heart,
- Warms my soul from within.
<!-- -->
- My dear can’t you see what I see ?
- My dear don’t you feel what I feel ?
<!-- -->
- Maybe—
- Under the chaos of the storm,
- You’d feel what I see,
- And you’d see how I feel.
